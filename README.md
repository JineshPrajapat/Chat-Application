# Real-Time Peer-to-Peer Messaging Application

## Overview
The Real-Time Peer-to-Peer Messaging Application is a full-stack web application built using **React.js** for the frontend and **Node.js** with **Express.js** for the backend. The app enables users to send and receive messages in real time, manage message history, view user statuses, and more. It offers essential messaging features like message delivery updates, deletion, and status tracking, while providing a seamless user experience optimized for performance and responsiveness.
